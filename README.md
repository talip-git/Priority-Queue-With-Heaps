# Priority-Queue-With-Heaps
Simple priority queue implementation written in java.
Array based approach.
It resizes or shrinks itself depending on the situation. If the queue is full, it will double in size. If array length is smaller than 1/4 of the current array,than it will divide and shrink to half.

There is also a main program which tests the priority queue. It parses commands from the file and reads them according to the time limit. Run command starts the execution.
